# Array_and_ArrayList
-- Directly Committed from GIT BASH --
## 📖 Project Description
This Java project covers three tasks related to arrays and ArrayLists:
1. **Separating Even and Odd Numbers** - Accept numbers from the user and store them in separate even and odd arrays.
2. **Finding Neighboring Numbers with the Smallest Distance** - Identify two adjacent numbers in an array with the smallest absolute difference and return the index of the first number.
3. **Converting Between Arrays and ArrayLists** - Convert an array to an ArrayList and vice versa.
This project follows proper **coding guidelines**, includes **detailed comments**, and ensures **modular implementation**.

##⚡ Functions & Methods
File	Function	Description:
- EvenOddArray.java	->seperateEvenOdd()	Reads user input and stores even and odd numbers in separate arrays.
- SmallestDistance.java  ->	findSmallestNeighboringDistance()	Finds two neighboring numbers with the smallest absolute difference.
- ArrayConversion.java ->	convertArrayAndArrayList()	Converts an array to an ArrayList and vice versa.


## 🛠️ **How to Run**:
- Go to Command Prompt then navigate to your project folder using cd "path_to_your_folder"
- then to complie the Main.java file  use command -> javac Main.java
- After this step you will get  a Main.class file this is the compiled file
- This .class file can be shared across different Operating Systems
- Then run the code using -> java Main
- Enjoy coding...
